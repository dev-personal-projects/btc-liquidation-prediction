# BTC Liquidation Prediction & Analysis

A computational analysis system that correlates Bitcoin liquidation patterns with price movements using real-time Telegram data feeds.

## üöÄ How It Works

This project analyzes the relationship between cryptocurrency liquidations and Bitcoin price movements by:

1. **Data Collection**: Fetches liquidation announcements from Telegram channels in real-time
2. **Price Integration**: Retrieves Bitcoin price data from multiple exchanges (Binance, CoinGecko)
3. **Pattern Analysis**: Aggregates liquidations by time intervals and correlates with future price movements
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Identifies patterns between liquidation types (long vs short) and subsequent price changes
5. **Visualization**: Generates comprehensive charts showing correlations and trends

### Key Features

- **Real-time Data Pipeline**: Automated fetching from Telegram liquidation channels
- **Multi-timeframe Analysis**: Support for 1H, 4H, 1D intervals
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Interactive charts with correlation analysis
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easy setup for different Telegram groups and timeframes
- **Robust Data Processing**: Handles missing data, outliers, and API rate limits

## üìä What You'll Discover

- **Liquidation-Price Correlations**: How long vs short liquidations predict price movements
- **Timing Patterns**: When liquidation clusters precede significant price changes
- **Volume Analysis**: Relationship between liquidation volume and price volatility
- **Net Liquidation Effects**: How the balance of long/short liquidations affects markets

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Telegram API credentials (get from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org))
- Access to liquidation Telegram channels

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd liquidation-prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Setup environment**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file with your Telegram credentials
   echo "TELEGRAM_API_ID=your_api_id" > .env
   echo "TELEGRAM_API_HASH=your_api_hash" >> .env
   echo "TELEGRAM_SESSION=.telegram_session" >> .env
   ```

4. **Verify setup**
   ```bash
   python check_setup.py
   ```

### Running Analysis

1. **Open the main notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/liquidation_analysis.ipynb
   ```

2. **Configure your analysis**
   - Set `DAYS_BACK` for historical analysis period
   - Choose `INTERVAL` (1H, 4H, 1D)
   - Run all cells to generate visualizations

3. **View results**
   - Price vs liquidation timeline charts
   - Correlation analysis plots
   - Predictive scatter plots
   - Statistical summaries
